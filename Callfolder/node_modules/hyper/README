###Meet Hyper's Hat

  Similar to beloved JavaScript projects like jQuery and Underscore, Hyper makes use of a vanity 
  symbol to denote its realm and namespace. 

  In Hyper, the Greek symbol **λ** is seen as a scripted letter *h*. I call it **Hat**.

  ```
    λ
  ```

  The challenge with Hyper's λ is that even though it's a valid identifier, it's not easily accessible from most keyboards! With this in mind, λ's promise to you is 3-fold:

  1. λ promises to put the fun(k) in fun(k)tionality.
  2. λ promises to only party where he's wanted.
  3. λ promises to be accesible for you.
