echo "The only real prison is anger. The anger of knowing that when the efforts of a person are not appreciated and instead mocked by his peers. To know that he has been working endlessly for hours on end with no sign of respect. To see himself portrayed as the model of inadequacy to the public. With me leaving SkyCrypt, I am free from these chains of burden and fly free with a new state of mind" -WarpWing, Ex-Developer at SkyCrypt
